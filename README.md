CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

**Architecture**

The Travlr Getaways web application uses the MEAN stack for both its front-end and back-end development. The MEAN framework consists of MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, and AngularJS. These four building blocks of the MEAN stack consist of MongoDB which is a document database that stores data in dynamic documents that are similar to JSON. Express.js is a web application framework. AngularJS is a front-end web framework that uses JavaScript to create single page and dynamic applications in the MVC architecture. And Node.js is a server-side platform used to design web applications using various JavaScript modules. The MEAN stack framework supports the MVC architecture and uses JSON for data transferring in a simple and flexible way.

**Functionality**


JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a file format used in object-oriented programming that uses human-readable language, text, and syntax to store and communicate data objects between applications. In the Travlr Gateways application, JSON was used for the trips data, packages, and config modules. JSONâ€™s ease of use and simplicity makes it an ideal options as a syntax to use thanks to being nearly identical to the code for and application using JavaScript objects.

**Testing**

One of the main ways that the SPA was tested, especially with the GET and PUT commands to interact with the database was by using an application called Postman. This API platform is specifically designed to assist developers in building and using API applications. Postman made is easy to test the checkpoints and verify successful HTTP response statuses by allowing GET and PUT calls to be made from the tool itself and check the results. The tool was also used to verify the creation and delivery of bearer tokens that were used for security processes to login and authorize operations such as adding, editing, and deleting trips. Additionally, a test-driven development model was applied throughout each iteration of the build process, by writing test logs and working with git repositories to collaborate with teams and ensure the application was developing as expected.

**Reflection**


By working on the Travlr Gateways web application, I was able to hands on experience building a full stack application. I gained some valuable skills in using the Express.js, Node.js, and Angular.js frameworks as well as how to test API endpoints using applications like Postman. Additionally, I was able to familiarize myself with HTML, which is necessary for web application, as well as how to use the MVC model for development with good practice using MongoDB for the database. These skills will be very important for my career aspirations as I want to become a software engineer that specialize in full stack development.
